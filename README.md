# Kyle Friel Frontend Engineering Portfolio

This portfolio was built using React and it's purpose is to display Kyle Friel's abilites as a Frontend Engineer.

The App is deployed with Github pages and can be accessed here: [https://kyle4real.github.io/Portfolio-v1/].

## Design

The design process started out with a mixture of layout brainstorming, inspiration seeking via a few google searches, and using a nifty color palette generator to help turn my unhinged color theme ideas into a harmonized set of hex codes. I decided to use scss so I could easily access the color codes, breakpoint mixin, and other crucial variables across all components. Plus, I enjoy the convenient nesting feature that scss offers.
